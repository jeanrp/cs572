        1- Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate insteadof using setTimeout?
    </p>
    <p style="width:50%;text-align:justify;">It depends on the order that you want to execute, because setImmediate is
        going to be executed when the check
        queue is executed, so they have different priority of executions, the setImmediate will be executed after the
        setTimeout when is the first execution, but if the setImmediate is put to be executed at the same time after the
        event loop is idle, the setImmediate will be executed first</p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;"> 2- Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?</p>
    <p style="width:50%;text-align:justify;">process.nextTick has more priority, because the nextTickQueue has more
        priority of execution than the check queue, so process.nextTick is going to be executed before the setImmediate
